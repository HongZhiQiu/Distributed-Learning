# Distributed learning in heterogeneous structure: Ambiguity-Free and Efficient Sparse Phase Retrieval 
The program primarily focuses on the restoration of sparse signals in a heterogeneous distributed architecture. We are currently about to unfold the neural network to accelerate computation, so some parts of the program, like ADMMNet, still require further modification. Additionally, the file "TrainingData" currently contains only 10 data entries. We will provide another download link later to release all the training data. The final version is expected to be released by June 30, 2024.
